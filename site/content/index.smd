# What is Dalek?
It is an audio engine for the sake of learning, such as a sandbox that I hope will turn into an audio engine for a future daw (Dark Rain).

# What is this page for?
This will be the ramblings of the design and production of [Dalek](https://github.com/furioncycle/dalek/). As I learn things, I will be writing about them in here.

# What are the goals of this project?

I will be explaining more of these in detail later on in posts. 

1. Learning about audio programming development
1. Getting better at Zig -> &#128498; &#128498; &#128498;
1. Following a more [Data Oriented](https://vimeo.com/649009599) design
1. Simplicity
